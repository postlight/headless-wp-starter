# WPUnit Tests
These are tests utilizing the WP_UnitTestCase. They're really integration tests more than "unit" tests, as they
test functionality of any particular piece of code in context of running with
WordPress core (and potentially other plugins or theme code). 

There are helper functions/factories for creating dummy data and making assertions against that data, etc.

These tests help ensure that WPGraphQL works with WordPress as it should.
