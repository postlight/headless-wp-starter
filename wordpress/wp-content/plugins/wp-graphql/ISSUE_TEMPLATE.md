Remember, an issue is not the place to ask general questions. You can use [Slack](https://wp-graphql.slack.com) for that ([join here](https://wpgql-slack.herokuapp.com/)).

Before you open an issue, please check if a similar issue already exists or has been closed before.

### When reporting a _bug_, please be sure to include the following:
- [ ] A descriptive title
- [ ] An *isolated* way to reproduce the behavior (example: GitHub repository with code isolated to the issue that anyone can clone to observe the problem)
- [ ] What version of `WPGraphQL` you're using, and the platform(s) you're running it on
- [ ] What other plugins you're using
- [ ] The behavior you expect to see, and the actual behavior

### When you open an _issue_ for a feature request, please add as much detail as possible:
- [ ] A descriptive title
- [ ] A description of the problem you're trying to solve, including *why* you think this is a problem
- [ ] An overview of the suggested solution
- [ ] If the feature changes current behavior, reasons why your solution is better
