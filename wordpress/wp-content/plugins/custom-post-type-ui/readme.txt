Admin UI for creating custom post types and custom taxonomies for WordPress

== Description ==

Custom Post Type UI provides an easy to use interface for registering and managing custom post types and taxonomies for your website.

CPTUI alone does not handle aspects related to the display of post type or taxonomy content. Its goal is simply the registration of both. For help with content display, please check out [Custom Post Type UI Extended](https://pluginize.com/product/custom-post-type-ui-extended/?utm_source=cptui-desription&utm_medium=text&utm_campaign=wporg). CPTUI-Extended provides tools intended to help display content from all registered types in your site.

Official development of Custom Post Type UI is on GitHub, with official stable releases published on WordPress.org. The GitHub repo can be found at [https://github.com/WebDevStudios/custom-post-type-ui](https://github.com/WebDevStudios/custom-post-type-ui). Please use the Support tab for potential bugs, issues, or enhancement ideas.
